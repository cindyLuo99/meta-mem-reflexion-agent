You make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed fridge right there by you. You can see a closed oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?
