Interact with a household to cook a meal. Here are two examples.
You are hungry! Let's cook a delicious meal. Check the cookbook in the kitchen for the recipe. Once done, enjoy your meal!

-= Kitchen =-
You make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed fridge right there by you. You can see a closed oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Well, here we are in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a fridge. Huh, weird. You see an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a yellow apple, a red hot pepper, a green apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Look over there! an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter! On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red tuna, a green bell pepper, a raw red potato and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.

On the counter you make out a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?
