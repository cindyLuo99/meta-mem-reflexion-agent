You make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed fridge right there by you. You can see a closed oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Well, here we are in the kitchen.

You make out a closed fridge. You see an oven. You wonder idly who left that here. If you haven't noticed it already, there seems to be something there by the wall, it's a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a knife. You can make out a counter. You see a banana, a red apple, a raw red tuna, a green apple, a tomato, a yellow apple and a cookbook on the counter. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a stove. The stove is conventional. Unfortunately, there isn't a thing on it. It would have been so cool if there was stuff on the stove.

Well, here we are in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a fridge. Huh, weird. You see an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a yellow apple, a red hot pepper, a green apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

Well, here we are in a kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can see a fridge. Huh, weird. You see an oven. Look out! It's a- oh, never mind, it's just a table. The table is massive. But the thing is empty, unfortunately. You can see a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you can see a red apple, a yellow apple, a red hot pepper, a green apple, a raw yellow potato, a cookbook and a knife. There's something strange about this thing being here, but you don't have time to worry about that now. You can see a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it.

You make a grand eccentric entrance into a kitchen. Let's see what's in here.

You can see a closed fridge right there by you. You can see a closed oven. You see a gleam over in a corner, where you can see a table. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. Hm. Oh well You make out a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you make out a red apple, a raw yellow potato, a raw red potato, a green apple, a green hot pepper, a yellow apple, a yellow bell pepper, a raw purple potato, a cookbook and a knife. You smell an interesting smell, and follow it to a stove. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. What, you think everything in TextWorld should have stuff on it?

Ah, the kitchen. This is some kind of kitchen, really great standard vibes in this place, a wonderful standard atmosphere.

Oh wow! Is that what I think it is? It is! It's a fridge. Look over there! an oven. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter! On the counter you can see a red hot pepper, a green hot pepper, a raw red tuna, a green bell pepper, a raw red potato and a knife. You can see a stove. The stove is conventional. But there isn't a thing on it.
