You've just sauntered into a kitchen.

You can see a closed fridge. You make out a closed oven nearby. You rest your hand against a wall, but you miss the wall and fall onto a table. However, the table, like an empty table, has nothing on it. You see a counter. You see a banana, a yellow apple, a raw yellow potato, a green apple, a red hot pepper, a cookbook and a knife on the counter. There's something strange about this being here, but you can't put your finger on it. You can make out a stove. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though. Oh! Why couldn't there just be stuff on it?

> think: To cook a delicious meal, I need to look at the cookbook and find the recipe. Let's see what ingredients I need to gather.
Ok.
> look at the cookbook
You open the copy of "Cooking: A Modern Approach (3rd Ed.)" and start reading:

OK.

OK.
> take the knife
You take the knife from the counter.
> slice the banana with the knife

Your score has just gone up by one point.
> roast the banana
That's not a verb I recognise.
> think: I need to roast the banana in the oven.
OK.
> roast the banana in the oven
That's not a verb I recognise.
> roast the banana in the oven
That's not a verb I recognise.
> think: I need to use the oven to roast the banana. I should open the oven first.
OK.
> open the oven
You open the oven.
> roast the banana in the oven
That's not a verb I recognise.
STATUS: FAIL
New plan: I was stuck in a loop, and I realized that using the term 'roast' repeatedly failed to produce the desired outcome when trying to cook the banana in the oven. Next time, I should try alternative phrases such as 'cook the banana in the oven' if the initial command is not recognised. It did not help to execute two identical commands in a row after receiving the same feedback. I will try to adapt to the game's vocabulary and pay attention to the feedback if I am stuck in a similar loop again.

Well, here we are in the kitchen. The room seems oddly familiar, as though it were only superficially different from the other rooms in the building.

You can make out a fridge. You idly wonder how they came up with the name TextWorld for this place. It's pretty fitting. You can make out a closed oven, which looks conventional, nearby. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you make out a cookbook and a knife. You lean against the wall, inadvertently pressing a secret button. The wall opens up to reveal a counter. The counter is vast. On the counter you see a red apple, a red hot pepper, a red onion, a green apple and an orange bell pepper. You see a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. But the thing hasn't got anything on it. You move on, clearly depressed by TextWorld.

STATUS: FAIL
New plan: Before cutting the ingredients, I need to make sure I have collected all necessary ingredients. I tried to take the red bell pepper directly from the counter; however, as provided in the description, the red bell pepper wasn't on the counter, so I failed to get that ingredient, thus unable to slice it. Specifically, when the game asks 'Which do you mean?', it could indicate that I may not have picked up the item yet. The next time, before attempting to use any ingredient in the recipe, I'll ensure to have physically collected it from the correct location. If I couldn't find the ingredient on the counter, I should check the fridge.
