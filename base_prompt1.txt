-= Kitchen =-
You are in a kitchen. A standard kind of place.
You see a closed fridge. You make out a closed conventional looking oven close by. You make out a table. The table is massive. On the table you see a cookbook and a knife. You can't wait to tell the folks at home about this! You can see a counter. You see a green hot pepper, a red hot pepper, a green apple, a red bell pepper, a raw red tuna and a green bell pepper on the counter. Hmmm... what else, what else? You can make out a stove. You wonder idly who left that here. The stove is conventional. Looks like someone's already been here and taken everything off it, though.
